# DevOps Automation and Deployment Pipeline

This project demonstrates the implementation of core DevOps practices to automate infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment.

## Key Features
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Automated development environment setup using Vagrant.
- **Configuration Management**: Managed server configurations and deployed applications using Ansible.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Set up automated testing and deployment pipelines.
- **Containerization**: Containerized applications using Docker and deployed them in a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Security Best Practices**: Enforced secure configurations through proper user management, file permissions, and firewall rules.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Vagrant**: For creating and managing virtualized development environments.
- **Ansible**: For automating server configurations and application deployment.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.
- **Docker**: For containerizing applications.
- **Kubernetes**: For deploying and managing containerized applications.
- **Prometheus**: For monitoring and alerting.
